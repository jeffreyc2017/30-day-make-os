This code is a bootloader for an operating system called Haribote OS, written in x86 assembly language. The code sets up the system environment, switches the CPU from real mode to protected mode, and loads the main operating system kernel (bootpack) into memory. Let's break down the code in detail:

### Constants and Equates

```assembly
BOTPAK	EQU		0x00280000		; Destination for bootpack loading
DSKCAC	EQU		0x00100000		; Location of disk cache
DSKCAC0	EQU		0x00008000		; Location of disk cache (real mode)

CYLS	EQU		0x0ff0			; Set by the boot sector
LEDS	EQU		0x0ff1
VMODE	EQU		0x0ff2			; Information about color depth
SCRNX	EQU		0x0ff4			; X resolution
SCRNY	EQU		0x0ff6			; Y resolution
VRAM	EQU		0x0ff8			; Start address of graphic buffer
```

These equates define memory locations used later in the code. `BOTPAK` is where the main OS kernel will be loaded. `DSKCAC` and `DSKCAC0` are locations used for disk caching. The other constants (`CYLS`, `LEDS`, etc.) are used for storing various boot information.

### Code Origin

```assembly
ORG		0xc400
```

This specifies the origin address where the program will be loaded in memory.

### Set the Screen Mode

```assembly
MOV		AL,0x13			; VGA graphics, 320x200x8-bit color
MOV		AH,0x00
INT		0x10
MOV		BYTE [VMODE],8	; Save screen mode for C language
MOV		WORD [SCRNX],320
MOV		WORD [SCRNY],200
MOV		DWORD [VRAM],0x000a0000
```

This block sets the screen to 320x200 resolution with 8-bit color using BIOS interrupt 0x10 and saves these settings in memory for later use.

### Get Keyboard LED Status

```assembly
MOV		AH,0x02
INT		0x16 			; keyboard BIOS
MOV		[LEDS],AL
```

This block retrieves the keyboard LED status (such as Caps Lock, Num Lock, etc.) using BIOS interrupt 0x16 and stores it.

### Disable All Interrupts

```assembly
MOV		AL,0xff
OUT		0x21,AL
NOP
OUT		0xa1,AL
CLI
```

This code disables all hardware interrupts by masking them in the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) and then disables interrupts at the CPU level.

The `NOP` (No Operation) instruction in the code sequence:

```assembly
MOV		AL,0xff
OUT		0x21,AL
NOP
OUT		0xa1,AL
CLI
```

is not strictly necessary for all systems but is included as a precaution to ensure reliability across various hardware implementations. Let's delve into why it might be there and whether it is essential.

### Purpose of the NOP Instruction

1. **I/O Timing Considerations**:

   - The `OUT` instructions are writing to the PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) registers, which control hardware interrupts. Some older or slower hardware might require a brief delay between consecutive `OUT` instructions to ensure the first command is fully processed before the next one is issued. The `NOP` instruction provides a small, predictable delay.

2. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - On some hardware, consecutive `OUT` instructions might cause timing issues, leading to incorrect operation or system instability. Inserting a `NOP` ensures that there is enough time for the first `OUT` to complete before the second `OUT` starts.

### Is the NOP Required?

In many modern systems, the `NOP` might not be strictly required due to advancements in hardware design and faster processing speeds. However, its inclusion can enhance compatibility and stability, particularly on older or less predictable hardware.

### Experimenting Without NOP

You can experiment by removing the `NOP` and testing the bootloader on your target hardware:

```assembly
MOV		AL,0xff
OUT		0x21,AL
OUT		0xa1,AL
CLI
```

If the system behaves correctly and initializes the PIC without issues, then for your specific hardware, the `NOP` is not necessary. However, if you encounter issues such as missed or improper initialization of the PIC, you may need to reintroduce the `NOP` or another form of delay.

### Best Practice

As a best practice, especially for bootloaders intended to run on a wide range of hardware, it is advisable to include the `NOP`:

- **Ensures Compatibility**: Including a `NOP` ensures that the bootloader is more likely to work correctly on older or slower systems.
- **Avoids Potential Bugs**: It prevents subtle timing-related bugs that might be difficult to diagnose.

### Conclusion

While not absolutely required on all hardware, the `NOP` instruction is a safeguard to ensure reliable operation across various systems. Removing it might work on modern hardware, but keeping it helps maintain broader compatibility and stability.

### Enable Access to Memory Above 1MB (A20 Gate)

```assembly
CALL	waitkbdout
MOV		AL,0xd1
OUT		0x64,AL
CALL	waitkbdout
MOV		AL,0xdf			; enable A20
OUT		0x60,AL
CALL	waitkbdout
```

This sequence enables the A20 line, allowing access to memory above 1MB, which is necessary for protected mode.

### Switch to Protected Mode

```assembly
LGDT	[GDTR0]
MOV		EAX,CR0
AND		EAX,0x7fffffff	; Set bit31 to 0 (disable paging)
OR		EAX,0x00000001	; Set bit0 to 1 (switch to protected mode)
MOV		CR0,EAX
JMP		pipelineflush
pipelineflush:
MOV		AX,1*8			;  Read-write segment, 32-bit
MOV		DS,AX
MOV		ES,AX
MOV		FS,AX
MOV		GS,AX
MOV		SS,AX
```

This block sets up the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and switches the CPU to protected mode by setting the appropriate bit in the CR0 register. The `pipelineflush` label ensures the CPU properly transitions to protected mode.

### Transfer Bootpack

```assembly
MOV		ESI,bootpack	; Source
MOV		EDI,BOTPAK		; Destination
MOV		ECX,512*1024/4
CALL	memcpy
```

This block copies the bootpack (the main OS kernel) from its source location to the designated destination in memory.

### Transfer Disk Data

```assembly
MOV		ESI,0x7c00		; Source
MOV		EDI,DSKCAC		; Destination
MOV		ECX,512/4
CALL	memcpy

MOV		ESI,DSKCAC0+512	; Source
MOV		EDI,DSKCAC+512	; Destination
MOV		ECX,0
MOV		CL,BYTE [CYLS]
IMUL	ECX,512*18*2/4
SUB		ECX,512/4
CALL	memcpy
```

This block transfers disk data from the boot sector and other parts of the disk to designated locations in memory.

### Boot the Main OS Kernel

```assembly
MOV		EBX,BOTPAK
MOV		ECX,[EBX+16]
ADD		ECX,3			; ECX += 3;
SHR		ECX,2			; ECX /= 4;
JZ		skip			; Nothing to transfer
MOV		ESI,[EBX+20]	; Source
ADD		ESI,EBX
MOV		EDI,[EBX+12]	; Destination
CALL	memcpy
skip:
MOV		ESP,[EBX+12]	; Initial value of stack
JMP		DWORD 2*8:0x0000001b
```

This block prepares to jump to the main OS kernel's entry point after setting up the initial stack.

### Subroutines

#### waitkbdout

```assembly
waitkbdout:
IN		AL,0x64
AND		AL,0x02
JNZ		waitkbdout
RET
```

This subroutine waits for the keyboard controller to become ready.

#### memcpy

```assembly
memcpy:
MOV		EAX,[ESI]
ADD		ESI,4
MOV		[EDI],EAX
ADD		EDI,4
SUB		ECX,1
JNZ		memcpy
RET
```

This subroutine copies data from the source to the destination, similar to the `memcpy` function in C.

### GDT and GDTR

```assembly
ALIGNB	16
GDT0:
RESB	8				; Null selector
DW		0xffff,0x0000,0x9200,0x00cf	; Read-write segment 32-bit
DW		0xffff,0x0000,0x9a28,0x0047	; Execute segment 32-bit (for bootpack)

DW		0
GDTR0:
DW		8*3-1
DD		GDT0
```

This block defines the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and its descriptor (GDTR). The GDT is necessary for setting up protected mode segments.

### Understanding the GDT and GDTR Setup

The given code block sets up the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and its descriptor (GDTR), which are crucial for switching the CPU to protected mode and defining memory segments. Here's a detailed explanation:

### GDT (Global Descriptor Table)

The GDT is a data structure used by Intel x86-family processors to define the characteristics of the various memory areas used during program execution, including the base address, the size, and access privileges like executability and writability. Each entry in the GDT is called a descriptor.

### Code Breakdown

```assembly
ALIGNB  16
```

- **Purpose**: Align the following data on a 16-byte boundary.
- **Explanation**: This ensures that the GDT starts at a memory address that is a multiple of 16. This alignment can improve performance and is required by some processors for certain data structures.

```assembly
GDT0:
```

- **Purpose**: Label marking the start of the GDT.
- **Explanation**: `GDT0` is the label used to reference the start of the GDT.

```assembly
RESB    8               ; Null selector
```

- **Purpose**: Reserve 8 bytes for the null descriptor.
- **Explanation**: The first entry in the GDT must be a null descriptor. This entry is not used for segment translation and is required by the x86 architecture to always be present.

### Segment Descriptors

Each segment descriptor is 8 bytes long. They define a memory segment's base address, size (limit), and access rights. Here are the detailed breakdowns for the two segment descriptors:

#### First Segment Descriptor: Data Segment (Read-Write)

```assembly
DW      0xffff,0x0000,0x9200,0x00cf ; Read-write segment 32-bit
```

- **Limit (0–15)**: `0xffff`
  - Segment limit (the size of the segment) set to 0xFFFF, which allows for a 64KB segment.
- **Base (0–15)**: `0x0000`
  - Base address of the segment is set to 0x0000.
- **Base (16–23)**: `0x00`
  - Continuation of the base address.
- **Access Byte**: `0x92`
  - Access flags:
    - 1 (present bit, segment is present in memory)
    - 00 (privilege level, 0 for kernel mode)
    - 1 (descriptor type, 1 for code/data segment)
    - 0 (type bit: data segment)
    - 1 (writeable, for data segment)
    - 0 (expansion direction, for data segment)
    - 0 (accessed bit, initially set to 0)
- **Limit (16–19) and Flags**: `0x0F`
  - Continuation of the limit (last 4 bits of the limit) and flags.
  - `0x0F` translates to:
    - Limit (16–19): 0xF
    - Flags: 0x0C (32-bit, granularity 4KB, available for system use, standard)
- **Base (24–31)**: `0x00`
  - Continuation of the base address.

#### Second Segment Descriptor: Code Segment (Execute)

```assembly
DW      0xffff,0x0000,0x9a28,0x0047 ; Execute segment 32-bit (for bootpack)
```

- **Limit (0–15)**: `0xffff`
  - Segment limit set to 0xFFFF.
- **Base (0–15)**: `0x0000`
  - Base address of the segment is set to 0x0000.
- **Base (16–23)**: `0x00`
  - Continuation of the base address.
- **Access Byte**: `0x9A`
  - Access flags:
    - 1 (present bit, segment is present in memory)
    - 00 (privilege level, 0 for kernel mode)
    - 1 (descriptor type, 1 for code/data segment)
    - 1 (type bit: code segment)
    - 1 (readable, for code segment)
    - 0 (conforming, for code segment)
    - 0 (accessed bit, initially set to 0)
- **Limit (16–19) and Flags**: `0x47`
  - Continuation of the limit and flags.
  - `0x47` translates to:
    - Limit (16–19): 0x7
    - Flags: 0x4 (32-bit, granularity 4KB, available for system use, standard)
- **Base (24–31)**: `0x00`
  - Continuation of the base address.

### GDTR (Global Descriptor Table Register)

The GDTR is a special register that holds the base address and limit of the GDT.

```assembly
DW      0
```

- **Purpose**: Reserve 2 bytes.
- **Explanation**: Placeholder to align subsequent data structures.

```assembly
GDTR0:
```

- **Purpose**: Label marking the start of the GDTR.
- **Explanation**: `GDTR0` is the label used to reference the start of the GDTR.

```assembly
DW      8*3-1
```

- **Purpose**: Set the size (limit) of the GDT.
- **Explanation**: The limit of the GDT is set to the size of three descriptors (null descriptor, data segment, and code segment). Since each descriptor is 8 bytes, the limit is `8*3-1 = 23` bytes.

```assembly
DD      GDT0
```

- **Purpose**: Set the base address of the GDT.
- **Explanation**: The base address of the GDT is set to the address labeled `GDT0`.

### Summary

- The **GDT** is set up with three descriptors: a null descriptor, a data segment, and a code segment.
- The **GDTR** is configured to point to this GDT and to indicate its size.
- This setup is necessary to switch the CPU to protected mode and properly manage memory segments.
- The alignment ensures optimal performance and adherence to required constraints for certain CPU operations.

### Bootpack Data

```assembly
ALIGNB	16
bootpack:
```

This marks the beginning of the bootpack data, which is the main OS kernel.

In summary, this code initializes the system, sets up protected mode, and loads the main OS kernel, preparing the system to run the operating system.

```sh
AH=0x00
AL=模式
0x03:80*25的16色模式
0x12:640*480*4
0x13:320*200*8
0x6a:800*600*4
```
