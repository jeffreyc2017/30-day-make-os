### Q&A on x86 Assembly Instructions

**Q: Why is the following code used in x86 assembly? Why can't we use `MOV ES, 0x0820` directly?**

```asm
MOV AX, 0x0820
MOV ES, AX
```

**A:** In x86 assembly language, the instruction `MOV ES, 0x0820` is not valid because the `MOV` instruction does not support moving an immediate value directly into a segment register. Segment registers such as `ES`, `CS`, `SS`, `DS`, `FS`, and `GS` can only be loaded from a general-purpose register or memory.

Here's why you see the code written in two steps:

1. **MOV AX, 0x0820**: This instruction moves the immediate value `0x0820` into the general-purpose register `AX`.
2. **MOV ES, AX**: This instruction then moves the value in `AX` into the segment register `ES`.

The sequence ensures that the segment register `ES` is loaded correctly. Segment registers require intermediate steps because they are not directly addressable by immediate values in the `MOV` instruction.

This is a restriction of the x86 architecture. To move an immediate value into a segment register, you must first load the value into a general-purpose register, and then transfer it to the segment register.

## what’s the difference between

`nasm -f bin -o asmhead.bin asmhead.nas`
and
`nasm -f elf -o asmhead.bin asmhead.nas`

The difference between these two commands lies in the output format specified by the `-f` option in the NASM (Netwide Assembler) command.

1. **nasm -f bin -o asmhead.bin asmhead.nas**

   - **`-f bin`**: This tells NASM to generate a flat binary file. A flat binary file is a raw sequence of bytes with no headers or metadata. It's typically used for very low-level programming, such as boot loaders or direct hardware manipulation, where you need to control the exact bytes that are written to a specific location.
   - **Output file**: `asmhead.bin` will be a flat binary file, which means it's suitable for environments where you need to load the code directly into memory and execute it, such as a boot sector or embedded system.

2. **nasm -f elf -o asmhead.bin asmhead.nas**

   - **`-f elf`**: This tells NASM to generate an Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file. ELF is a common file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps in Unix-like operating systems. It includes metadata like sections, symbols, and headers, which are used by linkers and loaders.
   - **Output file**: `asmhead.bin` will be an ELF object file, which can be linked with other object files and libraries to create a complete executable. This is useful for developing software that runs in user space on operating systems like Linux.

### Key Differences

- **Binary Format (`-f bin`)**:

  - Produces a raw binary file.
  - No headers or metadata, just raw machine code.
  - Suitable for boot loaders, direct hardware programming, or other low-level code.
  - Can be directly executed by a system or loaded into memory by a bootloader.

- **ELF Format (`-f elf`)**:
  - Produces an ELF object file.
  - Contains headers, metadata, and sections.
  - Suitable for linking with other object files.
  - Used by operating systems like Linux for executables and shared libraries.
  - Requires a linker to produce an executable file.

In summary, use `-f bin` when you need a raw binary output for low-level tasks, and use `-f elf` when you are developing software that needs to be linked and run in a Unix-like operating system environment.

## Create a floppy disk image

The command you provided:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=haribote.img bs=512 count=2880
```

creates a blank floppy disk image by writing zeros to it. Let's break down the command:

- `if=/dev/zero`: Input file is `/dev/zero`, which is a special file in Unix-like systems that provides as many null characters (zeros) as are read from it.
- `of=haribote.img`: Output file is `haribote.img`, the name of the disk image being created.
- `bs=512`: Block size is 512 bytes, which is the standard size of a sector on a floppy disk.
- `count=2880`: The number of blocks (sectors) to write, 2880 sectors corresponds to a standard 1.44MB floppy disk (512 bytes/sector \* 2880 sectors = 1,474,560 bytes or 1.44MB).

### Effects of This Command

Executing this command will create a 1.44MB disk image filled entirely with zeros. This means:

1. **Blank Disk Image**: The resulting `haribote.img` will be a completely blank disk with no file system, no bootloader, and no data.

2. **No File System**: There will be no FAT (File Allocation Table) or root directory, as these structures need to be created by formatting the disk image with a file system such as FAT12.

### Next Steps for Creating a Bootable FAT12 Disk Image

To make this disk image functional (e.g., as a bootable floppy with a FAT12 file system and a bootloader), you need to follow additional steps:

1. **Format the Disk Image with FAT12**:

   ```bash
   mkfs.vfat -F 12 haribote.img
   ```

2. **Write the Bootloader**:
   Assuming you have a bootloader binary called `bootloader.bin`:

   ```bash
   dd if=bootloader.bin of=haribote.img bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc
   ```

   This command writes your bootloader to the first sector of the disk image without truncating the image, ensuring the rest of the file system remains intact.

3. **Mount the Image and Add Files** (optional):
   If you want to add files to the FAT12 file system, you can mount the image using a loop device:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -o loop haribote.img /mnt
   sudo cp yourfile.txt /mnt
   sudo umount /mnt
   ```

### Conclusion

The initial `dd` command will not by itself break the FAT or root directory, as it creates a blank disk image with no file system at all. However, after creating the image, you must format it with a FAT12 file system and then write the bootloader to the first sector to make it a bootable FAT12 disk image. Following these steps ensures that the FAT and root directory are correctly established and not inadvertently broken.

## 1st sector of FAT12

The first sector of a FAT12 disk is not unused; it is reserved for the boot sector, which contains important information about the disk and its file system. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the role and contents of the first sector in a FAT12 disk:

### First Sector (Boot Sector)

1. **Boot Sector**: The first sector (sector 0) of a FAT12 disk is the boot sector. It serves several critical functions:
   - **Boot Code**: If the disk is bootable, this sector contains the bootloader code that is executed by the BIOS when the system boots from the disk.
   - **BIOS Parameter Block (BPB)**: This structure provides important details about the disk layout, such as the number of bytes per sector, sectors per cluster, number of reserved sectors, number of FAT copies, maximum number of root directory entries, total number of sectors, media descriptor, and other file system-specific parameters.

### Typical Layout of a FAT12 Disk

1. **Boot Sector**: Contains the boot code and BPB (sector 0).
2. **Reserved Sectors**: Usually just one sector (the boot sector itself), but sometimes more.
3. **FAT Region**: Contains the File Allocation Table(s), which manage the allocation of clusters on the disk.
4. **Root Directory Region**: A fixed-size area that contains the root directory entries.
5. **Data Region**: Contains the actual file and directory data, managed in clusters.

### Example Boot Sector Structure

A typical boot sector structure for a FAT12 disk might look like this:

- **Jump Instruction** (3 bytes): Tells the CPU to skip to the boot code.
- **OEM Name** (8 bytes): Identifies the disk format.
- **BIOS Parameter Block (BPB)** (25 bytes): Contains disk layout information.
- **Extended BPB** (26 bytes): Additional parameters (optional).
- **Boot Code**: The machine code to be executed on boot (usually up to 448 bytes in a 512-byte sector).
- **Boot Signature** (2 bytes): A signature value (0x55, 0xAA) indicating a valid boot sector.

### Writing a Bootloader Without Disrupting FAT12

When writing a bootloader to a FAT12 disk, it is crucial to ensure that the FAT12 structures remain intact. Here’s a corrected approach:

1. **Create a Blank Disk Image**:

   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=haribote.img bs=512 count=2880
   ```

2. **Format the Disk Image with FAT12**:

   ```bash
   mkfs.vfat -F 12 haribote.img
   ```

3. **Write the Bootloader to the Boot Sector**:
   Assuming your bootloader is `bootloader.bin`:
   ```bash
   dd if=bootloader.bin of=haribote.img bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc
   ```
   Ensure that `bootloader.bin` includes both the necessary boot code and the BPB.

By following these steps, you ensure that the first sector (boot sector) is properly formatted and includes both the bootloader and the necessary FAT12 disk layout information, preserving the integrity of the FAT12 file system.

## The start address of haribote.img is 0x4400 instead of 0x4200

03 day section 5 mentioned.

Tools used to check the haribote.img to confirm the haribote.sys location:

```sh
hexedit haribote.img
xxd haribote.img | less
sudo apt install sleuthkit
mmls haribote.img
fsstat haribote.img
xxd -s 0x004400 -l 512 haribote.img
xxd -s 0x004200 -l 512 haribote.img
fls haribote.img
icat haribote.img 4
istat haribote.img 4
```

Replaced all
ORG 0xc200 -> ORG 0xc400
JMP 0xc200 -> JMP 0xc400

## Assembler

`as` and `nasm` are both assemblers, but they are associated with different instruction set architectures and syntaxes:

1. **as (GNU Assembler):**

   - `as` is the GNU Assembler, which is part of the GNU Binutils suite.
   - It primarily targets the GNU/Linux operating system and supports various architectures, including x86, ARM, MIPS, and others.
   - It uses the AT&T assembly syntax by default, which is characterized by the use of `%` for registers and the order of operands in instructions.
   - `as` is often used in conjunction with the GCC compiler toolchain for compiling programs on Linux systems.

2. **nasm (Netwide Assembler):**
   - `nasm` is an independent, portable assembler that supports a wide range of architectures, including x86 and x86-64 (AMD64).
   - It uses its own syntax, which is often referred to as NASM syntax. This syntax is similar to Intel assembly syntax and is characterized by the use of square brackets for memory operands and a more intuitive instruction format.
   - `nasm` is popular among developers who prefer a more expressive and readable assembly language syntax, especially for writing low-level system software or operating systems.
   - Unlike `as`, `nasm` is not tied to any specific compiler toolchain and can be used independently for assembling assembly language source files into object files or executables.

## debug

在使用 QEMU 运行代码时，有几种工具和方法可以用来查看和调试内存分布。以下是一些常用的工具和方法：

### 1. QEMU Monitor

QEMU 提供了一个内置的监控工具，称为 QEMU Monitor。它允许你在运行时查看和修改虚拟机的状态，包括内存内容。

#### 启动 QEMU Monitor

启动 QEMU 时，可以使用 `-monitor` 选项来启用 QEMU Monitor。例如：

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=your_image.img,format=raw -monitor stdio
```

这会将监控控制台绑定到标准输入/输出，使你可以直接在终端中输入监控命令。

#### 常用命令

- `info mem`: 显示内存信息。
- `xp /fmt addr`: 以特定格式查看内存，例如 `xp /10x 0x00028000` 查看从地址 `0x00028000` 开始的 10 个字的数据。
- `x /fmt addr`: 与 `xp` 类似，但更常用于直接内存访问。

### 2. GDB (GNU Debugger)

GDB 是一个强大的调试工具，可以与 QEMU 一起使用，提供对虚拟机的详细调试功能。

#### 启动 QEMU 并启用 GDB Server

启动 QEMU 并启用 GDB Server：

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=your_image.img,format=raw -s -S
```

- `-s`：在 TCP 端口 1234 上启动 GDB Server。
- `-S`：启动后暂停虚拟机，等待 GDB 连接。

#### 启动 GDB 并连接到 QEMU

在另一个终端中启动 GDB 并连接到 QEMU：

```sh
gdb your_program.elf
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
```

在 GDB 中，你可以使用多种命令查看内存和寄存器的状态：

- `info registers`：查看寄存器状态。
- `x /fmt addr`：查看内存内容，例如 `x /10x 0x00028000`。

### 3. QEMU GUI 前端工具

有一些 GUI 前端工具可以与 QEMU 一起使用，以提供更友好的用户界面进行调试。例如：

- **QEMU GUI**: 提供了基本的虚拟机管理和监控功能。
- **Virt-Manager**: 一个常用的虚拟机管理工具，可以管理 QEMU/KVM 虚拟机，并提供图形化界面。

### 4. 内存查看工具

在内存中查找和查看特定内容可以使用一些特定的工具或脚本。例如：

- **hexedit**：一个简单的终端十六进制编辑器。
- **xxd**：一个将文件或标准输入进行十六进制转储的工具。

### 示例：使用 QEMU Monitor 查看内存

启动 QEMU 并启用 QEMU Monitor：

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=your_image.img,format=raw -monitor stdio
```

在 QEMU Monitor 中查看内存内容：

```sh
(qemu) xp /10x 0x00028000
```

这会显示从地址 `0x00028000` 开始的 10 个字的数据。

### 示例：使用 GDB 调试

启动 QEMU 并启用 GDB Server：

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=your_image.img,format=raw -s -S
```

在另一个终端中启动 GDB 并连接到 QEMU：

```sh
gdb your_program.elf
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
(gdb) x /10x 0x00028000
```

这会显示从地址 `0x00028000` 开始的 10 个字的数据。

### 总结

使用 QEMU Monitor 和 GDB 是查看和调试 QEMU 中运行的代码和内存分布的最常用和有效的方法。结合这些工具，你可以深入了解虚拟机内存的布局和内容，以调试和优化你的程序。

To include debug symbols in an ELF file compiled with NASM, you need to use the appropriate NASM options and directives to generate the necessary debugging information. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### Step 1: Write Your Assembly Code

Ensure your assembly code includes debugging information using the `dbg` section if necessary. For example:

```asm
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .bss

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Write your code here
    mov eax, 4          ; sys_write
    mov ebx, 1          ; file descriptor 1 is stdout
    mov ecx, msg        ; pointer to message
    mov edx, 13         ; message length
    int 0x80            ; call kernel

    ; Exit
    mov eax, 1          ; sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code 0
    int 0x80            ; call kernel
```

### Step 2: Assemble with NASM

Use the `-F` option to specify the debugging format and the `-g` option to include debugging information. NASM supports various debugging formats, but for ELF files, `dwarf` is a common choice.

```sh
nasm -f elf32 -F dwarf -g -o program.o program.asm
```

### Step 3: Link with LD

Link the object file to produce an executable. Ensure you use the appropriate flags to include debugging information:

```sh
ld -m elf_i386 -o program program.o
```

### Step 4: Verify Debug Symbols

You can use tools like `readelf` and `objdump` to verify that the debug symbols are included in your ELF file.

#### Using `readelf`:

```sh
readelf -S program
```

Look for sections like `.debug_info`, `.debug_abbrev`, `.debug_line`, etc., which indicate the presence of debugging information.

#### Using `objdump`:

```sh
objdump -h program
```

This will list all sections in the ELF file, including debug sections.

### Step 5: Debugging with GDB

You can now use GDB to debug your program:

```sh
gdb program
```

Within GDB, you can set breakpoints, step through the code, and inspect variables as usual:

```sh
(gdb) break _start
(gdb) run
(gdb) step
(gdb) info registers
(gdb) x/s msg
```

### Example Script

Here is a complete example script to automate the steps:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Assemble the program
nasm -f elf32 -F dwarf -g -o program.o program.asm

# Link the program
ld -m elf_i386 -o program program.o

# Verify the debug symbols
readelf -S program | grep debug
objdump -h program | grep debug

# Run GDB
gdb program
```

### Summary

- **NASM Compilation**: Use `-F dwarf -g` to include DWARF debug information.
- **Linking**: Use `ld` to link the object file, ensuring debug information is preserved.
- **Verification**: Use `readelf` and `objdump` to verify the presence of debug sections.
- **Debugging**: Use GDB to debug the ELF file with debug symbols.

This method will ensure that your ELF file generated with NASM includes the necessary debug symbols for effective debugging.

Yes, you can debug an x86 application running on a QEMU x86 virtual machine from an ARM host using GDB, but you need to use a cross-debugging setup. This involves using a cross-gdb (a version of GDB that can debug a different architecture than the one it is running on) that understands the x86 architecture.

Here's how you can set it up:

### Step 1: Install Cross-GDB for x86 on ARM Host

You need to install a GDB that can debug x86 applications. On many Linux distributions, this can be done using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian:

```sh
sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch
```

This `gdb-multiarch` version supports multiple architectures, including x86.

### Step 2: Start QEMU with GDB Server Enabled

Run your x86 application in QEMU with GDB server enabled:

```sh
qemu-system-i386 -drive file=your_image.img,format=raw -s -S
```

- `-s` starts the GDB server on port 1234.
- `-S` makes QEMU start in a paused state, waiting for GDB to connect.

### Step 3: Connect Cross-GDB to QEMU

Start `gdb-multiarch` and connect to the QEMU GDB server:

```sh
gdb-multiarch your_program.elf
```

In GDB, connect to the QEMU GDB server:

```sh
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
```

### Step 4: Debug Your Application

Now you can use GDB commands to debug your application:

```sh
(gdb) break _start
(gdb) continue
(gdb) step
(gdb) info registers
(gdb) x/s msg
```

### Complete Example

Let's put it all together with a complete script and example:

1. **Assembly Code** (program.asm):

   ```asm
   section .data
       msg db 'Hello, World!', 0

   section .bss

   section .text
       global _start

   _start:
       ; Write your code here
       mov eax, 4          ; sys_write
       mov ebx, 1          ; file descriptor 1 is stdout
       mov ecx, msg        ; pointer to message
       mov edx, 13         ; message length
       int 0x80            ; call kernel

       ; Exit
       mov eax, 1          ; sys_exit
       xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code 0
       int 0x80            ; call kernel
   ```

2. **Assembly and Link Script**:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash

   # Assemble the program
   nasm -f elf32 -F dwarf -g -o program.o program.asm

   # Link the program
   ld -m elf_i386 -o program program.o

   # Run QEMU with GDB server
   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=your_image.img,format=raw -s -S &
   ```

3. **GDB Connection Script**:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash

   # Start cross-gdb and connect to QEMU GDB server
   gdb-multiarch program <<EOF
   target remote localhost:1234
   break _start
   continue
   EOF
   ```

### Notes

- Ensure your QEMU image and assembly code are correctly set up and compiled.
- `gdb-multiarch` is used to handle multiple architectures, including x86 on ARM.
- The scripts automate the process of starting QEMU and connecting GDB for debugging.

With this setup, you can effectively debug an x86 application running on a QEMU x86 virtual machine from an ARM host.
