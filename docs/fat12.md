# FAT12

A 1.44 MB floppy disk typically uses the FAT12 file system. FAT12 is specifically designed for smaller storage media, such as floppy disks, and can handle the limited number of sectors and small file sizes associated with them.

In some cases, writing directly to the image may suffice, especially if the filesystem structure is simple and does not require additional metadata or directory structures.
