### Q&A on x86 Assembly Instructions

**Q: Why is the following code used in x86 assembly? Why can't we use `MOV ES, 0x0820` directly?**

```asm
MOV AX, 0x0820
MOV ES, AX
```

**A:** In x86 assembly language, the instruction `MOV ES, 0x0820` is not valid because the `MOV` instruction does not support moving an immediate value directly into a segment register. Segment registers such as `ES`, `CS`, `SS`, `DS`, `FS`, and `GS` can only be loaded from a general-purpose register or memory.

Here's why you see the code written in two steps:

1. **MOV AX, 0x0820**: This instruction moves the immediate value `0x0820` into the general-purpose register `AX`.
2. **MOV ES, AX**: This instruction then moves the value in `AX` into the segment register `ES`.

The sequence ensures that the segment register `ES` is loaded correctly. Segment registers require intermediate steps because they are not directly addressable by immediate values in the `MOV` instruction.

This is a restriction of the x86 architecture. To move an immediate value into a segment register, you must first load the value into a general-purpose register, and then transfer it to the segment register.
